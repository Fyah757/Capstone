In this Skill-based Assessment, you will be creating a small website, and you get to pick what the website is about. 
Your work will be graded based on the technical requirements below. Also, creativity always works in your favor.
Since this is your first time creating a 3-page website, keep it simple. Keeping it simple is very important. It ensures that you can complete this project within the given time and also gives you a better idea of what you can get done in the given time if you were to do it again with more requirements.
Once you have your idea, think from the user’s perspective when creating the website.  You like your users to have a good experience when interacting with your site. This gives you a better chance of users trusting your site and coming back for more. For this SBA, don’t worry too much about the content.
